The Challenge 
You  are  a  Data  Scientist  and  you  have  a  dataset  with  information  from  all  employees 
that have been working at a specific company during a time window. 
During these years, the Human Resources team collected data from employees and you 
have  been  asked  to  predict  the  attrition  of  an  employee,  i.e.  the  probability  of  an  employee 
with certain characteristics stay or quit his/her current job in the company. 
Predicting the employee attrition can be a demanding task due the complexness or even 
hidden information that may be behind the employee’s decision. Regardless the lack of some 
crucial  information,  you must  build  a  model  to  use by this company’s Human Resource team 
warning them about employees that potentially will quit. With something like that they can try 
to use some preventions methods such as giving better salaries; promote new and interesting 
projects; offer the opportunity to work remotely if the problem is related with job distance from 
home, let them suggest new tools, etc... to avoid that. 
This number of variables that may be involved but doing it may bring an enormous value 
to the employee and to the company itself. 
Another interesting mark of this use case is that many data sources can be used, giving 
the  students  the  opportunity  to  build  a  good  training  set  for  their  models  and  a  good 
understanding  of  the  feature extraction  process  (one  of  the  most  time consuming  and 
challenging procedures in Machine Learning). 
The customer we are working with is a multi-national company that works in 
consultancy area. They want to correlate the distance from home with the attrition rate. They 
also want to understand how important the variables are, and what makes an employee keep 
working on the company. 
The main goals are: 
• Descriptive Analytics: Find correlations between the different variables, 
possibility  of  clustering  analysis,  build  nice  visualizations  that  may  help  to  get 
better insights for the analysis, check feature’s cardinality and analyze possible 
highly correlation features that may be removed and still achieve good results. 
• Predictive Analytics: Build classification models to predict the Attrition 
probability and the final classification given by the model.
